<h2> Professional Experience </h2>

**Climate Co-Adaptation Lab Fellow**
[PlanAdapt (DE)][sbgr7oig]
Proposal development for climate change adaptation with a focus on GIS and EO technologies in sustainable agricultural development.

**Environmental Researcher | Geospatial Data Specialist** since Jan. 2020  
[WWF Water Risk Filter (DE)][8hbi6ucv] Feb. 2021 - present  
Working closely with the technical project manager, I have reviewed protocols to analyze corporate water risk data, refined data visualizations and mapped water risk types globally to support corporate partners in their path towards Water Stewardship. I've also automated data reporting workflows, leading to substantial reduction of the preparation time.

[SmartCloudFarming GmbH (DE)][2dg5i84s] Mar. 2020 - Feb. 2021  
Research and development in a production context: following the principles of agile development, I have coordinated a small team of data professionals and personally worked at the development of a minimum viable product (MVP) for the estimation of water content in agricultural soil.

- Performed literature research to identify state-of-the-art methods for the estimation of soil water content and soil organic carbon from satellite imagery
- Presented key findings in bibliographical reports
- Identified suitable data sources to facilitate programmatic access to satellite imagery, and to ground data  
- Developed data science pipelines to source and composite satellite imagery to train machine learning (ML) models, and prepared ground data to test and validate predictions
- Co-developed and fine-tuned ML models to predict soil moisture content from satellite data. The accuracy of predictions is satisfactory (R squared > 0.95, RMSE < 0.05)
- Generated interactive data visualizations and 3D maps to report model predictions to executives
- Developed dashboards to display ground data and model predictions to investors, and to potential clients  

[EarthRatings UG (DE)][sf46gh40] Jan. 2020 - Jun. 2020   
Identified and evaluated access options to data sets on Corporate Environmental Footprint (CEF) and Social Responsibility (CSR) with advanced web search techniques (e.g. truncation, boolean logic, connectivity search and media tagging) | Development of a web scraper program to source publicly available data | Conversion of raw contents to tabular formats and integration of open data sets from several sources | Exploratory analyses and visualization of the resulting data sets

[University of Primorska (SL)][bv7kewda]  Jan. 2020  
The role implied the revision of data storage procedures at the Conservation and Population Genetic research group led by Prof. Dr. Elena Bužan. The tasks included cleansing of genetic data sets and migration from data sheets to database tables, development of functional solutions for data storage in relational databases, automating data querying, and advising the research team on wildlife data management.
The work has been conduced using open-source software for data cleansing and manipulation, while proprietary database solutions (Microsoft Access) have been used for data storage.

**Professional re-qualification**, Oct. 2018 - Nov. 2019

Investigating the social system of the cheetah in central Namibia  
- Collected, processed and analyzed time series of GPS telemetry data
- Performed spatial and movement analyses on tracking data and airborne imagery
- Modelled the use of space by individuals with linear and nonlinear regression models
- Collected and analyzed presence-absence data via camera-trap surveys
- Designed and maintained online and offline geodatabases
- Engaged with stakeholders, and presented scientific results to the general public  through talks, data visualizations and reports
- Coordinated data collection in the field, supervised technicians and volunteers
- Organized scientific symposia  


**Research Assistant**, Feb. 2012 - Feb. 2013    
[CIBIO - Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources (PT)][87111420]  
Investigating the spatial ecology of endangered wildlife species in the Iberian peninsula (Portugal and Spain)  
- Collected and analyzed satellite telemetry and environmental data
- Modeled species distribution in relation to environmental variables using linear and nonlinear regression models
- Designed and maintained relational (geo)databases


**Research Technician**, Nov. 2010 - Nov. 2011  
[Department of Zoology and Evolutionary Genetics, University of Sassari (IT)][09879b80]    
Investigating spatial distribution, abundance and reproductive success of wolves in central Italy  
- Collected data on the presence-absence of wolves, and environmental variables
- Collected presence-absence data via camera-trap surveys
- Modelled presence-absence of wolves with multilinear regression models
- Collected and analyzed bio-acoustic data
