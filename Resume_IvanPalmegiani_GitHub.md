**Environmental Researcher | (Geo)Data Scientist**, since Nov. 2019    
[WWF Water Risk Filter (DE)][8hbi6ucv] Feb. 2021 - present  
As geospatial data consultant at the Water Risk Filter I reviewed protocols and automatized data reporting workflows. Working closely with the technical lead we have refined and developed data visualizations to support WRF corporate partners in their path towards Water Stewardship.  

[SmartCloudFarming GmbH (DE)][2dg5i84s] Mar. 2020 - present  
While working at the development of data products for precision agriculture my main responsibilities have been:
- Researching available literature to identify state-of-the-art methods for the estimation of soil moisture and soil organic carbon using remote sensing data
- Planning the different stages of the project and coordinating a small team of data professionals to make sure that objectives and key results would be hit on time
- Developing data science pipelines to source, clean and prepare ground data and satellite imaging for machine learning algorithms
- Co-developing and fine-tuning ML models to predict soil moisture content from satellite data. The accuracy of predictions is satisfactory (R squared > 0.95, RMSE < 0.05)
- Generating interactive data visualizations and reports for executives and their cooperators
- Developing ML dashboards to display data and results to potential clients  

[EarthRatings UG (DE)][sf46gh40] Nov. 2019 - Jun. 2020   
Working intermittently, I assisted the founder of this young start-up to research and to source public data set on Corporate Environmental Footprint (CEF) and Social Responsibility (CSR). I have developed a web crawler to scrape data, in accordance with the term and conditions regulating data use. At a later stage I have converted the raw data to 'tidy' format, and performed exploratory analyses.

[University of Primorska (SL)][bv7kewda]  Nov. 2019  
The  research lab led by Prof. Dr. Bužan at the Department of Biodiversity requested assistance in the management of wildlife genetic data. My main tasks have been:
- Data cleansing
- Development of relational databases
- Preparation of data queries to automatize and optimize data management
- Consulting on data management

**Professional re-qualification**, Oct. 2018 - Nov. 2019  
Data Science and Python programming courses | German language course | Conflict management and non-violent-communication (NVC) self-training | Personal development

**PhD Candidate**, May 2014 - Jun. 2018 | **Research Assistant**, Apr. 2013 - Sept. 2013  
[IZW - Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (DE)][bb58fb82]  
In the context of wildlife research, conservation and management, I investigated the social system of the cheetah in Namibian farmland. My main responsibilities were:
- Formulating evolutionary hypothesis on the social system of the cheetah
- Designing the study
- Coordinating and executing field operations involving live-capture of cheetahs, deployment GPS collars and the safe release of study animals into the wild, plus extensive camera-trap surveys of the capturing areas
- Engaging with local stakeholders and landowners, involving them in mitigation of human-wildlife conflict
- Processing and analyzing time series of geospatial data from satellite telemetry in near-real-time to plan field operations, and take actions in a timely manner
- Performing spatial and movement analyses of wildlife telemetry data
- Designing and maintaining online and offline geodatabases
- Writing scientific manuscripts
- Organizing scientific congresses and symposia
