<h2> Professional Experience </h2>

**Climate Co-Adaptation Lab Fellow** at [PlanAdapt][sbgr7oig]  
Fellowship, *since Apr. 2021*    
Proposal development for climate change adaptation with a focus on GIS and EO technologies in sustainable agricultural development.

**External Geospatial Data Consultant** at [WWF Water Risk Filter][8hbi6ucv]  
Contract, *Feb. 2021 - ongoing*  
Working closely with the technical project manager, I review protocols and methodologies to analyze corporate water risk data, design data visualizations and global water risk maps to support corporate partners in their path towards Water Stewardship. I'm in charge for the automation of data analysis and reporting workflows.

Tech stack: R GIS packages, Rstudio, R-Plotly, Conda, Git & GitHub.

**External Geospatial Data Scientist** at [SmartCloudFarming GmbH][2dg5i84s]  
Contract, *Mar. 2020 - Feb. 2021*  
Research and development in a production context: following the principles of agile development, I have coordinated a small team of data professionals and personally worked at the development of a minimum viable product (MVP) for the estimation of water content in agricultural soil.

- Performed literature research to identify state-of-the-art methods for the estimation of soil water content and soil organic carbon from satellite imagery
- Presented key findings in bibliographical reports
- Identified suitable data sources to facilitate programmatic access to satellite imagery, and to ground data  
- Developed data science pipelines to source and composite satellite imagery to train machine learning (ML) models, and prepared ground data to test and validate predictions
- Co-developed and fine-tuned ML models to predict soil moisture content from satellite data. The accuracy of predictions is satisfactory (R squared > 0.95, RMSE < 0.05)
- Generated interactive data visualizations and 3D maps to report model predictions to executives
- Developed dashboards to display ground data and model predictions to investors, and to potential clients  

Tech stack: Python GIS libraries, QGIS, sklearn, Python-Plotly, Streamlit, Conda, Docker, PostgreSQL-PostGIS, Google Earth Engine, Google Cloud Platform, Google App Engine

**External Data Consultant** at [Earth Ratings UG][sf46gh40]  
Contract, *Jan. 2020 - Jun. 2020*  
Explored CDP data and methodologies | Identified and sourced additional data sets on Corporate Environmental Footprint (CEF) and Social Responsibility (CSR) | Developed a web scraper program to source publicly available data in accordance with the respective terms of use | Converted raw contents to tabular formats and integration of open data sets from several sources | Exploratory analyses and visualization of the resulting data sets

Tech stack: web scarping and data munging was performed in Python

**External Data Management Consultant** at [University of Primorska][bv7kewda]  
Contract, *Jan. 2020*    
The role implied the revision of data storage procedures at the Conservation and Population Genetic research group. The tasks included cleansing of genetic data sets and migration from data sheets to database tables, development of functional solutions for data storage in relational databases, automating data querying, and advising the research team on wildlife data management.
The work has been conduced using open-source software for data cleansing and manipulation, while proprietary database solutions (Microsoft Access) have been used for data storage.

Tech stack: data munging in Python, user interfaces for data entry were generated with Microsoft Access
