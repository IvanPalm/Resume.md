<h2> Professional Experience </h2>

**Environmental Researcher | (Geo)Data Scientist**, Nov. 2019 - Present  
[SmartCloudFarming GmbH (DE)][2dg5i84s] Mar. 2020 - present  
Research and development in production context, i.e. developed data science pipelines any python programs to source ground data and satellite imaging, and to prepare data for machine learning algorithms. Co-developed and fine-tuned ML models to predict percent soil moisture at field level down to 45 cm depth from satellite data. The accuracy of predictions is satisfactory (R squared > 0.95, RMSE < 5%). Generated interactive data visualizations, and prepared data reports.  

Bibliographical research to identify state-of-the-art methods for the estimation of soil organic carbon from multispectral and hyperspectral satellite imaging. Screening of texts was performed with NLP algorithms. Selected manuscripts were read by human-eyes. ML approaches have been employed to generate reports of key contents
